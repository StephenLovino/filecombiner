**FileCombiner Overview**

FileCombiner is a utility application designed to merge files into a single file and extract embedded files from combined files. This tool is particularly useful for combining and extracting ZIP files embedded within larger files, such as MP4 files.

**Purpose:**

The primary advantage of FileCombiner is that it merges files without altering the original structure of the combined file. This minimizes the risk of corruption and ensures the integrity of the original file. For example, an MP4 file with an embedded ZIP file will still play correctly while containing the ZIP file.

Additionally, FileCombiner offers a unique feature for hiding or stealthily embedding sensitive files within normal-looking files like JPG images or videos. This functionality provides an edge by allowing users to securely store confidential files within seemingly innocuous files.

**Features:**

Combine Files: Merge multiple files into one. This can be useful for organizing or consolidating data without affecting the original file's structure.
Extract Files: Extract embedded ZIP files from a combined file, allowing you to access and manage the contents without altering the combined file.
Hide Sensitive Files: Stealthily embed sensitive files within normal-looking files, such as images or videos, for secure storage.
Usage:

Important Note:

**Testing:** Always test the tool on sample files before using it on important or irreplaceable files. This ensures that the merging and extraction processes work as expected and that your data is handled correctly.
**Disclaimer: The creator of this tool is not responsible for any damage or loss of files that may occur during the use of this application. Use it at your own risk and ensure that you have backups of your original files before performing any operations.**
