**FileCombiner Overview**

FileCombiner is a utility application designed to merge files into a single file and extract embedded files from combined files. This tool is particularly useful for combining and extracting ZIP files embedded within normal files, such as MP4 files. The method used for embedding files is called "concatenate," which allows for hiding sensitive files within normal-looking files.

**Purpose:**

FileCombiner merges files into a single file using the "concatenate" method, which hides sensitive files within normal-looking files. For example, an MP4 file can have a ZIP file embedded within it. The combined file retains its original format and can be played as a normal video without users noticing the embedded ZIP file. To access or manage the embedded file, you need to separate or extract it using the FileCombiner application.

**Features:**

- **Combine Files:** Merge multiple files into one using the concatenate method, which hides sensitive files within normal files without altering their recognizability.
- **Extract Files:** Separate or extract embedded ZIP files from a combined file using the FileCombiner application, allowing you to access and manage the contents.
- **Hide Sensitive Files:** Stealthily embed sensitive files within normal-looking files like images or videos for secure storage.

**Important Note:**

**Testing:** *Always test the tool on sample files before using it on important or irreplaceable files. This ensures that the merging and extraction processes work as expected and that your data is handled correctly.*

**Disclaimer:** *The creator of this tool is not responsible for any damage or loss of files that may occur during the use of this application. Use it at your own risk and ensure that you have backups of your original files before performing any operations.*
